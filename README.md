# rush-shell
The official repository of the rush shell. The Rust Utility Shell

## Why write such a piece of software? Isn't `fish`, a better shell, written mostly in rust, readily available?

Because I want to learn Rust. Also I'm writing my own OS, so if I want to implement a shell, this would be pretty nice to add to it.
Also I need more projects on my portfolio.
